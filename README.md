# Lambda-Rubiks-Cube

A small lisp like language with dependent types for tex based verification system. 

## Creation purposes

I start this project to unite paper writing and verefication processes. My main purpose is write only tex (maybe with aditional rules) and have ability to verify it.

## Dependent types

Now it uses a Pi lambda calculus with Si types.

## Features list

- [x] Pi types
- [x] Si types
- [ ] Algebraic data types
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Module system
- [ ] Tex plugin
